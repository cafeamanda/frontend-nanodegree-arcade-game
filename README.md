# Front-End Nanodegree Arcade Game: Frogger

This project was built under the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program. It is a recreation of the classic arcade game **Frogger** developed by Konami. The object of the game is to safely direct the little boy all the way to the river by crossing a busy road full of enemies.

## Instructions
* If you're on a **desktop**, use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move across the map.
* Every time you safely reach the river, **+1** point is added in your scoreboard
* You win the game if you safely cross 10 times.
* ⚠️ **CAREFUL**: if you collide with an enemy, **ALL** of your points will be lost.

## Additional features
* You can check your progress at all times by looking at the **scoreboard** at the top of your screen.
* If you're on a **mobile device**, use the `◀`, `▲`, `▶`, `▼` controllers that appear on your screen to move instead.
* In the desktop version, you can **choose between 5 different characters** to play with by pressing the numbers 1-5 on your keyboard.
